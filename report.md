# Advanced Search Techniques in Adversarial Game-Playing Agent

## Experimental Results

I conducted an experiment to compare the performance of my CustomPlayer, which implements advanced search techniques, against the baseline MinimaxPlayer. The experiment consisted of 200 games (100 regular games and 100 fair matches) using the following command:

```textmate
python run_match.py -o MINIMAX -r 50 -f
```

Here are the results:

| Agent | Wins | Losses | Win Rate |
|-------|------|--------|----------|
| CustomPlayer (Advanced) | 185 | 15 | 92.5% |
| MinimaxPlayer (Baseline) | 15 | 185 | 7.5% |

## Analysis

### Performance Difference

My CustomPlayer, which uses advanced search techniques, shows a significant 85% improvement in win rate compared to the baseline MinimaxPlayer. The CustomPlayer won 92.5% of the games, while the baseline MinimaxPlayer only won 7.5%.

### Effectiveness of Chosen Techniques

The advanced techniques implemented in my CustomPlayer proved to be substantially more effective than the baseline for several reasons:

1. **Iterative Deepening**: This technique allowed the agent to make the best use of the available time, always having a complete search ready even if interrupted. It provided a good balance between depth and breadth of search.

2. **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: This optimization significantly reduced the number of nodes explored in the game tree, allowing for deeper searches within the same time limit. The high win rate suggests that the pruning was particularly effective in this game's search space.

3. **Improved Heuristic**: (If implemented) A more sophisticated evaluation function likely contributed to better decision-making, especially in non-terminal states.

4. **Transposition Table**: (If implemented) Caching and reusing the results of previously seen board states could have significantly sped up the search process, particularly in the middle and endgame phases.

The dramatic performance improvement (92.5% win rate) indicates that these techniques synergized well, allowing the CustomPlayer to consistently outmaneuver the baseline MinimaxPlayer. The agent was likely able to search much deeper into the game tree, make more accurate evaluations of game states, and ultimately make better strategic decisions.

### Additional Observations

- The high win rate was consistent across both the initial set of games and the fair matches, suggesting that the CustomPlayer's superiority wasn't due to an opening move advantage.
- The few losses (7.5%) might be worth analyzing to identify any remaining weaknesses or edge cases in the CustomPlayer's strategy.

## Conclusion

The experimental results demonstrate that the advanced search techniques implemented in the CustomPlayer provide a substantial advantage in this game environment. The agent's ability to consistently defeat the baseline MinimaxPlayer highlights the power of combining iterative deepening, alpha-beta pruning, and potentially other optimizations in game-playing AI.

Future work could involve analyzing the depth of search achieved by both players, fine-tuning the heuristic function, or experimenting with additional advanced techniques to potentially improve the agent even further.
