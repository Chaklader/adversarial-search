This course introduces a knowledge-based AI agent who can reason and plan. This lesson shows how to use symbols to represent 
logic and reasoning. Before we move on to the next lesson on the introduction to planning, let's recap what we have learned 
in this lesson.

As we have seen in the previous course, a problem-solving AI agent does not store knowledge about the world. The agent relies 
on the algorithms, such as Constraint Satisfaction Problem and Search, to find the solutions in state space. A knowledge-based 
AI agent, however, has full or partial knowledge about the world and can make inferences from the knowledge.

For a knowledge-based AI agent to be able to reason and plan, they must apply logic to the knowledge about the world. The 
simplest form of logic is Propositional Logic. Propositional logic is the simplest language consisting of symbols and logical 
connectives. But it can only handle boolean propositions, which are True, False or Unknown.

We moved on to learn First Order Logic, which can help the knowledge-based agents to learn about the knowledge of the world 
through the more powerful knowledge representations. FOL is built around objects and relations. It also has universal and 
existential quantifiers to construct assertions about all or some of the possible values of the quantified variables.

In the next lesson, we will learn how to define problems so our knowledge-based AI agents can plan to solve the problems 
through explicit propositional and relations between states and actions.


Propositional Logic

Propositional logic is a fundamental form of logic that deals with propositions (statements that are either true or false) 
and logical connectives. It's a building block for more complex logical systems and is crucial in AI for representing and 
reasoning about knowledge.

Key Components:

1. Propositional Symbols:
   - Represent atomic propositions (e.g., B for Burglary, E for Earthquake)
   - Can be either true or false

2. Logical Connectives:
   - NOT (¬): Negation
   - AND (∧): Conjunction
   - OR (∨): Disjunction
   - IMPLY (⇒): Implication
   - IF AND ONLY IF (⇔): Biconditional

3. Model:
   - A set of true/false assignments to all propositional symbols
   - Example: {B: True, E: False, A: True, M: False, J: True}

4. Sentences:
   - Formed by combining propositional symbols with connectives
   - Example: (E ∨ B) ⇒ A (If there's an Earthquake OR Burglary, then the Alarm will sound)

5. Truth Values:
   - Sentences are evaluated as either true or false with respect to a given model
   - Truth tables are used to define the meaning of connectives

Example Sentences:
- A ⇒ (J ∧ M): If the Alarm sounds, then John AND Mary will call
- J ⇔ M: John calls if and only if Mary calls
- J ⇔ ¬M: John calls if and only if Mary doesn't call

Key Points:
1. Propositional logic deals with absolute truth values, not probabilities.
2. It's limited to expressing facts about specific propositions and can't generalize.
3. Truth tables are used to evaluate complex sentences.
4. It forms the basis for more complex logics like First-Order Logic.


In AI and automated planning, propositional logic is used to represent states, actions, and goals in a simple, boolean manner. 
It allows for basic reasoning about the truth of statements in different scenarios, which is fundamental for planning and 
decision-making algorithms.


Truth Table


| P     | Q     | ¬P    | P ∧ Q | P ∨ Q | P ⇒ Q | P ⇔ Q |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| False | False | True  | False | False | True  | True  |
| False | True  | True  | False | True  | True  | False |
| True  | False | False | False | True  | False | False |
| True  | True  | False | True  | True  | True  | True  |

Explanation of the truth table:

1. ¬P (NOT P):
   - True when P is False, False when P is True.

2. P ∧ Q (P AND Q):
   - True only when both P and Q are True.

3. P ∨ Q (P OR Q):
   - True when either P or Q (or both) are True.

4. P ⇒ Q (P IMPLIES Q):
   - False only when P is True and Q is False.
   - True in all other cases, including when P is False (vacuous truth).

5. P ⇔ Q (P IF AND ONLY IF Q):
   - True when P and Q have the same truth value (both True or both False).
   - False when P and Q have different truth values.


This truth table is fundamental in propositional logic as it defines the behavior of logical connectives for all possible 
combinations of truth values of P and Q. It allows us to evaluate complex logical statements by breaking them down into 
their constituent parts and applying these rules.



Q#1: (P is false, Q is false):
Correct answer: (P ∧ (P ⇒ Q)) ⇔ (¬ (¬P ∨ ¬Q))

Explanation:
- P ∧ (P ⇒ Q) is false because P is false.
- ¬ (¬P ∨ ¬Q) is false because ¬P ∨ ¬Q is true (both ¬P and ¬Q are true).
- The equivalence of two false statements is true.

Q#2(P is false, Q is true):
Correct answer: (P ∧ (P ⇒ Q)) ⇔ (¬ (¬P ∨ ¬Q))

Explanation:
- P ∧ (P ⇒ Q) is false because P is false.
- ¬ (¬P ∨ ¬Q) is false because ¬P ∨ ¬Q is true (¬P is true).
- The equivalence of two false statements is true.

Q#3(P is true, Q is false):
Correct answer: (P ∧ (P ⇒ Q)) ⇔ (¬ (¬P ∨ ¬Q))

Explanation:
- P ∧ (P ⇒ Q) is false because P ⇒ Q is false when P is true and Q is false.
- ¬ (¬P ∨ ¬Q) is false because ¬P ∨ ¬Q is true (¬Q is true).
- The equivalence of two false statements is true.

Q#4(P is true, Q is true):
Correct answers: All three statements

Explanation:
- P ∧ (P ⇒ Q) is true because both P and P ⇒ Q are true.
- ¬ (¬P ∨ ¬Q) is true because ¬P ∨ ¬Q is false (both ¬P and ¬Q are false).
- (P ∧ (P ⇒ Q)) ⇔ (¬ (¬P ∨ ¬Q)) is true because both sides are true.


In all cases, the equivalence statement is true because it represents a tautology - a statement that is always true regardless 
of the truth values of its components. This demonstrates an important principle in propositional logic about logical 
equivalences.


Q#1:
Given that (E v B) ⇔ A, A ⇔ (J ∧ M), and B are all true statements, what is the value of the variable E?

Correct Answer: Cannot be determined
Explanation: While we know B is true, E could be either true or false. If E is true, (E v B) is true. If E is false, (E v B) 
is still true because B is true. Therefore, we can't determine E's specific value.

Q#2:
Given that (E v B) ⇔ A, A ⇔ (J ∧ M), and B are all true statements, what is the value of the variable B?

Correct Answer: True
Explanation: The question directly states that B is a true statement.

Q#3:
Given that (E v B) ⇔ A, A ⇔ (J ∧ M), and B are all true statements, what is the value of the variable A?

Correct Answer: True
Explanation: Since (E v B) ⇔ A is true and B is true, (E v B) is true. Therefore, A must be true for the equivalence to hold.

Q#4:
Given that (E v B) ⇔ A, A ⇔ (J ∧ M), and B are all true statements, what is the value of the variable J?

Correct Answer: Cannot be determined
Explanation: We know A is true, and A ⇔ (J ∧ M) is true. This means (J ∧ M) must be true, but we can't determine if J is true 
or false without knowing M's value.

Q#5:
Given that (E v B) ⇔ A, A ⇔ (J ∧ M), and B are all true statements, what is the value of the variable M?

Correct Answer: Cannot be determined
Explanation: Similar to J, we know (J ∧ M) is true, but we can't determine M's specific value without knowing J's value.


1. Valid Sentence:
   - Definition: A sentence that is true in every possible model.
   - Explanation: No matter what truth values you assign to the individual propositional symbols, the sentence always evaluates to true.
   - Example: P ∨ ¬P (P or not P) is valid because it's always true regardless of whether P is true or false.
   - Also known as a tautology.

2. Satisfiable Sentence:
   - Definition: A sentence that is true in at least one model.
   - Explanation: There exists at least one assignment of truth values to the propositional symbols that makes the sentence true.
   - Example: P ∧ Q is satisfiable because it's true when both P and Q are true, even though it's not true in all cases.
   - Note: All valid sentences are satisfiable, but not all satisfiable sentences are valid.

3. Unsatisfiable Sentence:
   - Definition: A sentence that cannot be true in any possible model.
   - Explanation: No matter what truth values you assign to the propositional symbols, the sentence always evaluates to false.
   - Example: P ∧ ¬P (P and not P) is unsatisfiable because it's always false.
   - Also known as a contradiction.

Key Points:
- A valid sentence is true in all models.
- A satisfiable sentence is true in at least one model.
- An unsatisfiable sentence is false in all models.
- Every sentence is either satisfiable or unsatisfiable.
- Valid sentences are a subset of satisfiable sentences.


These concepts are crucial in logical reasoning and form the basis for many algorithms in artificial intelligence, including 
automated theorem proving and logical inference systems.


Q#1:
Is the following sentence valid, satisfiable, or unsatisfiable? P ∨ ¬P

Correct Answer: Valid
Explanation: This sentence is a tautology, which is always true regardless of the truth value of P. If P is true, P ∨ ¬P 
is true. If P is false, ¬P is true, so P ∨ ¬P is still true. Therefore, it's valid (true in all possible models).


Q#2:
Is the following sentence valid, satisfiable, or unsatisfiable? P ∧ ¬P

Correct Answer: Unsatisfiable
Explanation: This sentence is a contradiction. It can never be true because P cannot be simultaneously true and false. 
Therefore, it's unsatisfiable (false in all possible models).


Q#3:
Is the following sentence valid, satisfiable, or unsatisfiable? P ∨ (P ∧ Q)

Correct Answer: Not provided in the image, but the correct answer would be Satisfiable.
Explanation: This sentence is true whenever P is true, regardless of Q's value. It's also true when both P and Q are true. 
However, it's false when P is false and Q is true. Therefore, it's satisfiable (true in some models, but not all).


Q#4:
Is the following sentence valid, satisfiable, or unsatisfiable? (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ ¬Q)

Correct Answer: Not provided in the image, but the correct answer would be Satisfiable.
Explanation: This sentence is equivalent to P ∧ (Q ∨ ¬Q). It's true whenever P is true, regardless of Q's value. However, 
it's false when P is false. Therefore, it's satisfiable (true in some models, but not all).


Q#5:
Is the following sentence valid, satisfiable, or unsatisfiable? ((Food ∧ Party) ∨ (Drinks ∧ Party)) ⇔ ((Food ∨ Drinks) ∧ Party)


Correct Answer: Not provided in the image, but the correct answer would be Valid.
Explanation: This sentence is a logical equivalence. The left side is true when there's a party with food or drinks (or both). 
The right side expresses the same condition. This equivalence holds for all possible combinations of truth values for Food, Drinks, 
and Party. Therefore, it's valid (true in all possible models).


Limitations of Propositional Logic 

   1. It can only handle boolean value (ie. true or false) and does not have a capability to handle complex values, such as 
      uncertainty (probability value).
   2. It can't include objects that have properties, such as size, weight, color, nor shows the relationship between objects.
   3. There are no shortcuts to succinctly talk about a lot of different things happening.


Building Elements of First Order Logic (FOL)

   1. Objects: are the noun phrases that refer to things, such as a house, a person, an event.

   2. Relations: are the verb phrases among the objects. The relations can be a property, such as "the car is red", or a function, 
      which maps the input to an output, such as "times two". FOL expresses the facts about some or all of the objects in the world. 
      It represents the general laws or rules. For example, in this sentence of "Peter Norvig wrote the best Artificial Intelligence 
      textbook", the objects are "Peter Norvig" and "textbook", the property are "the best" and "Artificial Intelligence", and the relation is "wrote".


FOL may remind you of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Similar to FOL, OOP is a programming paradigm around objects, 
rather than functions or logics. Both FOL and OOP objects can have properties and functions (or methods). FOL, however, 
is different from OOP, in which FOL has a declarative nature that separates the knowledge of the world and their inferences. 
The other difference is that OOP lacks the expressiveness required to handle partial information, such as if x is in loc A, 
then it is not in loc B.


1. Propositional Logic Models:
   - In PL, a model is a simple assignment of truth values (true or false) to propositional variables.
   - Each variable represents an entire proposition, which is a statement that is either true or false.
   - Example: pl_model = { P: true, Q: false, R: true }
   - This model states that proposition P is true, Q is false, and R is true.
   - PL cannot represent internal structure within these propositions.

2. First Order Logic Models:
   - In FOL, a model is more complex and represents a richer structure of the world.
   - It consists of:
     a) A domain of objects (e.g., people, books)
     b) Relations between these objects
     c) Functions that map objects to other objects
   - Example: fol_model = { Write(Author(Peter), Book(AI textbook)) }
   - This model represents:
     * Objects: Peter (an Author), AI textbook (a Book)
     * Function: Author() maps a name to an author object
     * Function: Book() maps a title to a book object
     * Relation: Write() represents the action of an author writing a book

3. Key Differences:
   - Expressiveness: FOL can express relationships and properties of objects, while PL can only express truth values of whole statements.
   - Structure: FOL models have internal structure (objects, relations, functions), while PL models are flat assignments.
   - Quantification: FOL allows for statements about all objects or some objects in the domain, which is not possible in PL.
   - Partial Information: FOL can handle partial information about objects and their relationships, which PL cannot do effectively.

4. Implications:
   - FOL can represent more complex scenarios and reasoning tasks.
   - It allows for more nuanced and detailed modeling of real-world situations.
   - FOL supports reasoning about categories of objects and their properties, not just individual propositions.

5. Example Comparison:
   - PL: "It's raining" (R) and "The ground is wet" (W) might be represented as R ∧ W
   - FOL: "All days when it rains, the ground is wet" might be represented as ∀x(Raining(x) → Wet(Ground, x))
     where x represents days, Raining is a predicate about days, and Wet is a relation between objects and days.


In summary, FOL models provide a much richer and more flexible framework for representing knowledge about the world, allowing 
for more sophisticated reasoning and inference compared to the simpler boolean world of Propositional Logic.


The symbols ∀ and ∃ are quantifiers in First Order Logic (FOL). They are fundamental to expressing complex logical statements 
about sets of objects. Let's break them down:

1. ∀ (Universal Quantifier):
   - Pronunciation: "For all" or "For every"
   - Meaning: It indicates that the statement is true for all instances in the domain.
   - Example: ∀x P(x) means "For all x, P(x) is true"
   - Real-world usage: ∀x (Human(x) → Mortal(x))
     This means "For all x, if x is human, then x is mortal"

2. ∃ (Existential Quantifier):
   - Pronunciation: "There exists" or "For some"
   - Meaning: It indicates that the statement is true for at least one instance in the domain.
   - Example: ∃x P(x) means "There exists an x such that P(x) is true"
   - Real-world usage: ∃x (Planet(x) ∧ HasLife(x))
     This means "There exists an x such that x is a planet and x has life"

Key points:
- ∀ is often used with implications (→)
- ∃ is often used with conjunctions (∧)
- These quantifiers allow FOL to express more complex ideas than propositional logic
- They can be combined to create even more sophisticated statements

Example combining both:
∀x (Dog(x) → ∃y (Human(y) ∧ Owns(y, x)))
This means "For all x, if x is a dog, then there exists a y such that y is human and y owns x"

In AI and automated reasoning, these quantifiers are crucial for representing general knowledge and making inferences about 
sets of objects or entities.



1. Components of FOL Syntax:

   a) Sentences: Describe facts that are true or false.
      Examples: 
      - Vowel(A)
      - Above(A, B)
      - 2 = 2

   b) Terms: Describe objects.
      Examples:
      - Constants: A, B, 2
      - Variables: x, y
      - Functions: Number_of(A)

2. Logical Connectives:
   ¬ (NOT), ∧ (AND), ∨ (OR), ⇒ (IMPLY), ⇔ (IF AND ONLY IF)
   
   These work similarly to propositional logic.

3. Quantifiers:
   a) Universal Quantifier (∀): "For all"
   b) Existential Quantifier (∃): "There exists"

4. Syntax Patterns:

   a) Universal Quantification often uses implication:
      ∀x Vowel(x) ⇒ Number_of(x) = 1
      "For all x, if x is a vowel, then the number of x is 1."

   b) Existential Quantification often uses conjunction:
      ∃x Number_of(x) = 2
      "There exists an x such that the number of x is 2."

5. Additional Examples:

   a) ∀x Dog(x) ⇒ Mammal(x)
      "All dogs are mammals."

   b) ∃x Planet(x) ∧ HasRings(x)
      "There exists a planet that has rings."

   c) ∀x (Student(x) ∧ Hardworking(x)) ⇒ WillSucceed(x)
      "For all x, if x is a student and x is hardworking, then x will succeed."

   d) ∃x Politician(x) ∧ Honest(x)
      "There exists a politician who is honest."

6. Important Notes:

   - Omitting quantifiers usually implies universal quantification.
   - Universal quantification (∀) naturally pairs with implication (⇒).
   - Existential quantification (∃) naturally pairs with conjunction (∧).
   - FOL allows for more complex and nuanced expressions than propositional logic.

7. Practical Application:

   In AI and automated reasoning, FOL can be used to represent complex knowledge and make inferences. For example, in a 
   robot navigation system:

   ∀x (Obstacle(x) ⇒ Avoid(robot, x))
   "For all x, if x is an obstacle, the robot should avoid x."

   ∃x (SafePath(x) ∧ LeadsTo(x, goal))
   "There exists a safe path that leads to the goal."

These constructs allow AI systems to reason about general principles and specific instances in a way that closely mimics 
human logical thinking.


First Order Logic in Vacuum World

1. Initial State:
   At(V,A)
   - The vacuum cleaner V is initially at location A.

2. Equations:

   a) ∀d ∀l Dirt(d) ∧ Loc(l) ⇒ ¬At(d,l)
      Interpretation: For all dirt d and locations l, if d is dirt and l is a location, then d is not at l.
      Meaning: Initially, no dirt is at any location.

   b) ∃l ∃d Dirt(d) ∧ Loc(l) ∧ At(V,l) ∧ At(d,l)
      Interpretation: There exists a location l and dirt d such that d is dirt, l is a location, the vacuum is at l, and the dirt is at l.
      Meaning: There is at least one location where both the vacuum and some dirt are present.

   c) ∀R Transitive(R) ⇔ (∀a,b,c R(a,b) ∧ R(b,c) ⇒ R(a,c))
      Interpretation: For all relations R, R is transitive if and only if for all a, b, and c, if R(a,b) and R(b,c) are true, then R(a,c) is true.
      Meaning: This defines the property of transitivity for any relation R.

3. Key Points:
   - Equation (a) seems to contradict (b). This likely represents different states of the world (initial vs. possible future state).
   - Equation (b) implies that the vacuum can coexist with dirt in the same location, possibly representing a state before cleaning.
   - Equation (c) is a general logical statement about transitive relations, not specific to the vacuum world but useful in logical reasoning.

4. Implications for AI Planning:
   - These statements provide both constraints and possibilities for the AI system.
   - The planner must consider how to move from the state in (a) to achieve states like (b), and then to a clean state.
   - Understanding transitive relations (c) could be crucial for planning efficient cleaning routes.

5. FOL Advantages:
   - Allows expression of complex relationships and rules.
   - Can represent both specific facts (like the vacuum's location) and general rules (like the definition of transitivity).
   - Provides a foundation for logical inference in AI systems.

These equations demonstrate how First Order Logic can be used to represent and reason about complex scenarios in AI planning 
and problem-solving.


Question 1:
Is the following sentence valid, satisfiable, or unsatisfiable? ∃x: y: x = y

Correct Answer: Satisfiable
Explanation: This sentence states that there exists an x such that for all y, x equals y. This is satisfiable in a domain 
with only one element, where every x and y would be equal. However, it's not valid because it's not true in all possible 
domains (e.g., a domain with multiple distinct elements).

Question 2:
Is the following sentence valid, satisfiable, or unsatisfiable? (∃x: x = x) ∨ (∀y ∃z: y = z)

Correct Answer: Valid
Explanation: This sentence is always true, making it valid. The left part (∃x: x = x) is always true because for any domain, 
there exists an x that equals itself. Even if the right part were false, the sentence would still be true due to the OR (∨) 
operator.

Question 3:
Is the following sentence valid, satisfiable, or unsatisfiable? ∀x: P(x) ∨ ¬ P(x)

Correct Answer: Valid
Explanation: This sentence is a tautology in first-order logic. For any predicate P and any object x, either P(x) is true 
or its negation ¬P(x) is true. This holds for all possible interpretations of P and all possible domains, making it valid.

Question 4:
Is the following sentence valid, satisfiable, or unsatisfiable? ∃x: P(x)

Correct Answer: Satisfiable
Explanation: This sentence states that there exists an x for which the predicate P is true. It's satisfiable because we 
can construct a model where P is true for at least one object. However, it's not valid because we can also construct 
models where P is false for all objects. It's also not unsatisfiable because it can be true in some models.


List of logical statements under the heading "VSU", which stands for Valid, Satisfiable, and Unsatisfiable. 

1. ∃x,y x=y
   - This statement is Satisfiable.
   - It means "There exist x and y such that x equals y."
   - This is true in any non-empty domain, as any object can be equal to itself.

2. (∃x x=x) ⇒ (∀y ∃z y=z)
   - This statement is Valid.
   - The left side (∃x x=x) is always true in any non-empty domain.
   - The right side (∀y ∃z y=z) is also always true, as for any y, we can choose z to be y itself.
   - Since the implication is from a true statement to another true statement, it's always valid.

3. ∀x P(x) ∨ ¬P(x)
   - This statement is Valid.
   - For any x, either P(x) is true or its negation ¬P(x) is true.
   - This is a tautology in first-order logic, true for any predicate P and any domain.

4. ∃x P(x)
   - This statement is Satisfiable.
   - It means "There exists an x for which P(x) is true."
   - This can be true or false depending on the interpretation of P and the domain.
   - It's not valid (as it's not necessarily true for all interpretations) and not unsatisfiable (as we can construct models where it's true).

The VSU classification helps in understanding the nature of these logical statements:
- Valid statements are true in all possible interpretations.
- Satisfiable statements are true in at least one interpretation.
- Unsatisfiable statements are false in all possible interpretations.

This classification is crucial in logic and reasoning systems, helping to determine which statements are always true, which 
can be true under certain conditions, and which are never true.

1. ∃x,y Job(Sam,x) ∧ Job(Sam,y) ∧ ¬(x=y)
   Answer: Y (Yes)
   Explanation: This statement is true (Yes) because it asserts that Sam has at least two different jobs. The existential 
   quantifier (∃) allows for the possibility of Sam having multiple jobs, and the inequality (¬(x=y)) ensures they are distinct.

2. ∀x,s Member(x, Add(x,s))
   Answer: Y (Yes)
   Explanation: This is likely true (Yes) as it states that for all x and s, x is a member of the set resulting from adding 
   x to s. This is a fundamental property of set addition.

3. ∀x,s Member(x,s) ⇒ (∀y Member(x, Add(y,s)))
   Answer: Y (Yes)
   Explanation: This is true (Yes) because it states that if x is a member of s, then x remains a member of s after adding 
   any y to s. This is a logical property of set operations.

4. ∀x,y Adj(Sq(x,y), Sq(+(x,1),y)) ∧ Adj(Sq(x,y), Sq(x,+(y,1)))
   Answer: Y (Yes)
   Explanation: This statement is true (Yes) as it defines adjacent squares on a grid. It states that for all x and y, the 
   square at (x,y) is adjacent to the square at (x+1,y) and the square at (x,y+1). This correctly defines horizontal and 
   vertical adjacency in a grid.

The "Y N | Adjacent squares" header suggests that these statements are all true (Y) and relate to the concept of adjacent squares, 
which is consistent with the explanations provided.



Question 1:
Is the following first-order logic sentence a good representation of the English language sentence, "Sam has two jobs"?
∃x, y: Job(Sam, x) ∧ Job(Sam, y) ∧ ¬(x = y)

Correct Answer: Yes

Explanation: This first-order logic sentence accurately represents "Sam has two jobs." It states that there exist two 
things (x and y) such that both are jobs of Sam (Job(Sam, x) and Job(Sam, y)), and these two things are not the same (¬(x = y)). 
This captures the essence of having two distinct jobs.

Question 2:
Are the following first-order logic sentences a good representation of the concept of set membership?
∀x, s: Member(x, Add(x, s)) ∀x, s: Member(x, s) ⇒ (∀y: Member(x, Add(y, s)))

Correct Answer: Yes

Explanation: These sentences accurately represent key properties of set membership:

   1. The first sentence states that for any x and set s, x is a member of the set resulting from adding x to s.

   2. The second sentence states that if x is a member of s, then x remains a member of s after adding any y to s.
   These properties correctly describe how set membership behaves under addition operations.

Question 3:
Is the following first-order logic sentence a good representation of the concept of adjacent squares on a chessboard?
∀x, y: Adj(sq(x, y), sq(+(x, 1), y)) ∧ Adj(sq(x, y), sq(x, +(y, 1)))

Correct Answer: Yes

Explanation: This sentence accurately represents adjacent squares on a chessboard:

   1. It states that for all x and y coordinates, the square at (x, y) is adjacent to the square at (x+1, y) (horizontally 
   adjacent).

   2. It also states that the square at (x, y) is adjacent to the square at (x, y+1) (vertically adjacent).

This captures both horizontal and vertical adjacency, which are the two types of adjacency on a chessboard (excluding diagonal 
adjacency, which isn't typically considered in chess movements except for specific pieces).


Planning VS Execution


Planning vs. Execution Challenges in Real-World Scenarios:

1. Uncertain Environments:
   a) Stochastic:
      - Outcomes of actions are not deterministic
      - Results can't be predicted with certainty
      - Example: Weather affecting outdoor plans

   b) Multiagent:
      - Multiple actors in the environment
      - Actions of one agent affect others
      - Example: Traffic flow affected by multiple drivers

   c) Partial Observability:
      - Agent can't fully observe the environment
      - Relies on belief state rather than actual state
      - Example: Robot navigation with limited sensor range

2. Agent's Internal Knowledge:
   a) Unknown:
      - Agent lacks prior knowledge about certain states
      - Must learn or discover information during execution
      - Example: Exploring an unmapped area

   b) Hierarchical:
      - Actions and outcomes aren't linear
      - Involves nested or layered decision-making
      - Example: Project management with multiple subprojects

3. Key Terminology:
   - Non-deterministic vs. Stochastic:
     * Both describe uncertainty
     * Stochastic: Quantifiable randomness (probabilities)
     * Non-deterministic: Different outcomes possible, not quantified

4. Implications for Planning:
   - Plans must be flexible and adaptable
   - Need for contingency planning
   - Importance of real-time decision making
   - Continuous monitoring and re-planning may be necessary

5. Strategies to Address Challenges:
   - Probabilistic planning methods
   - Multi-agent coordination algorithms
   - Belief state updating techniques
   - Learning and adaptation mechanisms
   - Hierarchical planning approaches

6. [A,S,F,B] Notation:
   - Likely represents different aspects or approaches to planning
   - Could stand for: Action, State, Function, Belief (but context is needed for confirmation)


These challenges highlight the complexity of real-world planning and the need for sophisticated AI planning systems that 
can handle uncertainty, partial information, and dynamic environments.
